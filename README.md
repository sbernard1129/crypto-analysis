Project Description/Outline

Portfolio analysis of alternative assets using the S&P or various markets as a benchmark.

Using the interactive dashboard, the user will select the crypto they are interested in and the benchmark they are comparing their portfolio to (if any). 

Research Question To Answer

How can I construct a low/medium/high risk portfolio?
What is a conservative or aggressive portfolio?

CoinGeco - API
Coinbase - API 

Rough breakdown of tasks:
Pull 5 years of data for various cryptos
Clean & sort data 
Conduct analysis on all cryptos and create visualizations for all scenarios
