### Project Description/Outline

Portfolio analysis of alternative assets using the S&P or various markets as a benchmark. We will conduct analysis of various cryptocurrencies to help future investors make decisions on investing in crypto. Using the interactive dashboard, the user will select the crypto they are interested in and the benchmark they are comparing their portfolio to (if any). 

### Research Question To Answer
* Is my crypto portfolio low risk or high risk?
* How are my portfolio assets correlated?
* How can I construct a low/medium/high risk portfolio?
* What and how do we  define a conservative or aggressive portfolio?
* How is my crypto performing to different benchmarks (S&P/DOW)
