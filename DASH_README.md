### 11-8 Cathy Notes

Submitting a dash_working.ipynb with a test dataframe, two test charts/functions defined and the initial panel definitions. Syntax error on pn.column does not make sense, but this should be returning a working visual panel with tabs.

I have researched widgets, parameters, and pipelines.
    * Widgets should provide interactivity with user (ie: select coins)
    * Pipelines could help us with movement from tab to tab, if we want to incorporate that
    * Parameters are extensions/helpers to create widgets and incorporate the pipelines.

**Question**: Chris - how does this deliverable mesh with your notebook so far? Let me know if we need to discuss before next steps below.

Next steps:
    1. Define functions for the plots. **Question**: Farah/Steve - Are the plots all defined? I saw the social bar chart but didn't see the other ones. No worries if you're still working on them. Plenty to do here.
    2. Begin customization of panel dashboard (ie: overall look, color, fonts)
    3. Begin coding for interactive functionality (widgets, pipelines)
    
Cathy's next deliverable - Monday night.
